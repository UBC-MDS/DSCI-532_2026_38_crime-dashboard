## Crime Trends Dashboard

> The Crime Trends Dashboard is an interactive data visualization tool that explores city level UCR crime data from 1975 - 2015. It allows users to analyze long term trends in violent and property crime, filter by city and year range, and compare patterns across multiple cities. The dashboard helps public safety analysts quickly identify historical shifts, peak crime periods, and differences in crime trajectories to support data driven decision making.
